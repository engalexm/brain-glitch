verse 1
you’ve had a long day, so let me take all your laundry down
and your boss has been a dick
let me rub you out from your neck to your back
i’ll be working down
stay with me, and you’ll see
lessen all of your doubt
girl, you got me washing dishes, and i’ll clean the kitchen
watch the stove for ya closely while i’m whippin dinner
won’t let the pot boil over
but this girl, since her
i’ve been thinking like i’m really tryna stick with her

chorus
it's 3000 percent, 3000 percent, satisfaction guaranteed, 3000 percent
it's 3000 percent, 3000 percent, satisfaction guaranteed, 3000 percent
in my head, in my chest, red blood is pumping
one thing led to the next, now we’re onto something
i’ll do anything just to keep your heart thumping
satisfaction guaranteed
let’s get to lovin

verse 2
so we’ve got some time, let’s recline
and think about all the things we want to do together
like i’ll take ya to a cabin
in the mountains
whenever there’s some bad weather
we can ski and nap and drink hot cocoa, and then, uh
maybe we can stay there forever
i just wanna get everything locked up tight
‘cause you and i gotta be
got me feeling so right
stick with me, and you’ll see
or i think that we might
hug and hold hands
bring each other some light

bridge
get me folding clothes
get me minding stoves
get me on all fours
just to scrub the floors
i am committed
i ain’t afraid of nothing
3000 percent, it’s true
i’ll give 3000 percent with you

chorus (x2)
it's 3000 percent, 3000 percent, satisfaction guaranteed, 3000 percent
it's 3000 percent, 3000 percent, satisfaction guaranteed, 3000 percent
in my head, in my chest, red blood is pumping
one thing led to the next, now we’re onto something
i’ll do anything just to keep your heart thumping
satisfaction guaranteed
let’s get to lovin

outro
