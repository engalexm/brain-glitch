chorus
girl don’t you know what you’re doin to me
i’ll be anything that you want me to be, so
come on baby won’t you please set me free
press my chest with your hands, sugar, let me breathe

verse 1
i’ve got just the time to say
that i hope that you give me the time of day
i would let you lead my mind astray
cause you got me feelin some type of way

chorus
girl don’t you know what you’re doin to me
i’ll be anything that you want me to be, so
come on baby won’t you please set me free
press my chest with your hands, sugar, let me breathe

verse 2
you caught me off guard
and now i’m fallin hard
feelin like a rock star
burnin like some hot tar
please see me as someone more
than just another lost boy left ashore

chorus
girl don’t you know what you’re doin to me
i’ll be anything that you want me to be, so
come on baby won’t you please set me free
press my chest with your hands, sugar, let me breathe

verse 3
if you just let me in, i would be someone that
got you off
turnin on all your lights
on your back
when you come to my place
you could keep all that’s packed
leave a bag by my bed
you're in my head
that’s a fact

chorus
girl don’t you know what you’re doin to me
i’ll be anything that you want me to be, so
come on baby won’t you please set me free
press my chest with your hands, sugar, let me breathe

verse 4
i know that you don’t drive, but you
got me speedin down i-95
i love every single trick that you might try
just to bring me closer to you right by your side
