verse 1
i like the way that you look around when you
try to think of your words out loud
then you turn your head like side to side
and you give a great big smile that’s wide
when you think hard your nose scrunches up
and i feel my heart beat crunching numbers bout my
frequency of daily thoughts about you
can i be alright feeling lost without you
i like

chorus
honey butter, you’re my honey butter, baby
honey butter, you’re my honey butter, baby
honey butter, you’re my honey butter, baby
sweet and smooth, just like honey butter, baby

verse 2
please let me know if i’m thinking too fast
or if too wide my net is cast
but you make me see futures that i thought had passed
or at least i thought that my hopes got dashed
of a life shared instead of searching alone
compatibility in love with love as a home to come back to
no longer will i roam
i’ll tell you how i’m really feeling
please pick up the phone
i’ll call you

chorus
honey butter, you’re my honey butter, baby
honey butter, you’re my honey butter, baby
honey butter, you’re my honey butter, baby
sweet and smooth, just like honey butter, baby

verse 3
and i know that you’ve got no time for some
people coming in to your life with them
self-obsessed, stressed negative vibes
let ‘em go to somewhere else
let’s try together
we can be there through the thick and the thin
we can help each other look deep within
and find a partner’s help through life’s challenge events
or just new adventures shared with you as my friend
i’ll be your

chorus (x2)
honey butter, you’re my honey butter, baby
honey butter, you’re my honey butter, baby
honey butter, you’re my honey butter, baby
sweet and smooth, just like honey butter, baby
