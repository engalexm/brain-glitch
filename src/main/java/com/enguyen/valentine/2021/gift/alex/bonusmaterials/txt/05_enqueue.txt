verse 1
there was a time when i had thought
that you and i would just be friends
and even then, i didn’t expect to be caught
in these feelings for you way, way back when
now we’ve been going like this for a minute
and i know i feel like i’m so far from finished
but technicality says we never technically started
still, i feel like for the first time i’m really living

chorus
it’s just the most we can do for now
it’s still something real for me and you
and i can’t wait to finally meet you
and try all the things we need to dequeue

verse 2
i see your smile on my phone screen
i hear you laugh, let loose, go free
we’re hanging out through space, so we
forget at night to feel lonely
i think about the space between us
and how long it’s been since we have been us
italicized the latter reference
‘cause we’ve got some loose ends to clean up

chorus
it’s just the most we can do for now
it’s still something real for me and you
and i can’t wait to finally meet you
and try all the things we need to dequeue

verse 3
at the end of the day, what i’m trying to say
is if you’ve got the patience to wait for me
then so do i
i’m not the guy
who’s blind when gifts from heaven drop right into my mind
so please excuse my distance
for i’ve done it poorly before
but with you, i’m writing my best sentence
since with you, i’m always wanting more

chorus
it’s just the most we can do for now
it’s still something real for me and you
and i can’t wait to finally meet you
and try all the things we need to dequeue

bridge
random shit
btw i mean crazy like beyonce and jay-z
meets gnarls barkley
not like *crazy* crazy lol

verse 4
it hurts to hang up on your pouting face
my heart gets heavy then it starts to race
when onto my screen up pops your name
and i remember when you told me you felt the same
so as soon as this time apart is behind us
i’m lacing up my sneakers, and i’m trying to find ya
and grab you in my arms with the heart that defines us
kiss you, then i’ll tell you how i’ve just made my mind up
about you
