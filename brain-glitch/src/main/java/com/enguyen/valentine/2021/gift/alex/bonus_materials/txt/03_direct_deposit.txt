verse 1
it’s been a minute since i rapped on a track like this
i’ve been carryin everything on my back like this
so if i'm about to go ahead and blow a pack like this
i'm about to go explode spittin facts like this
i act like this, because you know i really like ya
and i just want to tell you everything in spite of
mentally, i think i’ve run astray in light of
penciling my schedule full of feeling brighter
i’ll be real, in the past, i’ve been hurtin bad
been up and down like a trend, i know i'm a fad
when someone else picks me up, i can fly their flag
then when i’m just by myself, i’ll be feeling sad
maybe it is something that i just need to grapple with
even if it’s nothing, i can’t cower in my alex shit
people out there think i’m real, like i mastered it
but the biggest issue that i know is that i’m acting it

hook
this is not a hook, it is just direct deposit
if you don’t like this, you can go ahead and pause it
when i’m with you, girl, i know i get to talkin
now all these thoughts pourin out of me like a faucet
full disclosure cause i'm feeling like we’re on it
been a few times that i nearly thought i lost it
came closer to you when i really first saw it
now you are here, like me, we bought caught it

verse 2
historically, i’ve been late staring at my ceiling
it takes time for a man to learn how to heal, and
when i went out my mind, things i tried dealing
with alone, ‘cause i’d grown, sick and tired of feeling
i prefer not to dwell on the things i’ve lost
but in my head i go calculate the cost
i don’t know if i’ll ever be my own boss
still, i’ll look on the street just before i cross
remember me when people say my name
speak on me contribute to my fame
infamy, more like i just want the same
energy, so i'm glad you came
empathy (um) never been the strongest
skill of mine, (some) body get up on this
the flaws that i am always come back crawling
but every day is new, with you, i’ll be calling

hook
this is not a hook, it is just direct deposit
if you don’t like this, you can go ahead and pause it
when i’m with you, girl, i know i get to talkin
now all these thoughts pourin out of me like a faucet
full disclosure cause i'm feeling like we’re on it
been a few times that i nearly thought i lost it
came closer to you when i really first saw it
now you are here, like me, we bought caught it

verse 3
so i’ll be hoping
i mean, my bank is open
please make an orderly line, we’ll be just fine
feeling like we’re flying, i mean i know i’m just quite simply
speaking my mind
giving you my direct deposit, so
i hope till now if you’re enjoyed this message
i’ll teach you a lesson
i think you are a blessing
you know, like perhaps, sent down from heaven
but that’s, i guess, a story for another time
if you liked this, miss
please hit rewind
so, uh, anyway
that was my day
what have you been up to?
did you eat yet?
