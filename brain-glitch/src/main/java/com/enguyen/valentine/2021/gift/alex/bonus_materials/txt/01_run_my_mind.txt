verse 1
i had a couple dark days spent at the bottom of a hole i dug
for me, myself, and i
i dream about laying awake at night with thoughts to try to lead myself to die
although i'm not a man of luck, suddenly i see
the universe has sent me a friend
i build my trust, and my chest feels tight again
over time i see my days are better when she’s in them

chorus
i felt my heart open for you
honey, i love lethal these days
and you got me
i'm yours to take
set my heart in to flames, baby
we could just stay here for a while
just i with you running my mind

verse 2
today is the day of the first time i make you smile when we meet
since we caught the vibes, i try my best to see a mile ahead
i’ve been planting my feet
to get to you, my darling
there ain’t nothing that could hope to get in my way
because you got me good
at night i think of kissing you all over the place

chorus
i felt my heart open for you
honey, i love lethal these days
and you got me
i'm yours to take
set my heart in to flames, baby
we could just stay here for a while
just i with you running my mind

verse 3
it’s just the beginning of us lady
it’s been a minute since i called you last
but i know you well enough to know you’re in my grasp
so won’t you let me take your hand in mine, baby
i know my feelings never been more clear, but for you my dear
i think i’ve fallen here
so fast i know we will last

chorus (x2)
i felt my heart open for you
honey, i love lethal these days
and you got me
i'm yours to take
set my heart in to flames, baby
we could just stay here for a while
just i with you running my mind
